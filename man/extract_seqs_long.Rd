\title{Function to extract sequences from symportal output}
\usage{
extract_seqs_long(
  folder,
  type = "relative",
  clade = LETTERS[1:10],
  remove_zero = TRUE,
  threshold = 0,
  drop_samples = NULL,
  keep_samples = NULL,
  drop_seqs = NULL,
  silent = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{location of the root Symportal output}

\item{type}{returns either "relative" or "absolute"}

\item{clade}{filter by single "C" or multiple clades c("C", "D") to filter sequences by}

\item{threshold}{Set threshold to remove samples if less than the threshold (defaults to 1000)}

\item{drop_samples}{drop samples by named vector, e.g. c("H00B07", "H00B06"), or by one or more partial matches, e.g. c("07","B06")}

\item{keep_samples}{drop samples by named vector, e.g. c("H00B07", "H00B06"), or by one or more partial matches, e.g. c("07","B06")}

\item{drop_seqs}{drop seqs by named vector, e.g. c("X2777817_G", "X2777816_G"), or by one or more partial matches, e.g. c("X2","OT")}

\item{silent}{defaults to TRUE, if FALSE then prints a list of removed sample names}
}
\value{
A data.frame of seq.ID (columns) and sample.ID (rows) with either relative or absolute abundance of sequences.
}
\description{
same as extract_seqs but in long format
